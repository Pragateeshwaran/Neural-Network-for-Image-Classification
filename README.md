## Introduction

This project demonstrates a basic neural network for image classification. The neural network is implemented using Python and NumPy and can be used to classify images into different categories.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `neural_network.py`: The main script containing the neural network implementation.
- `train_X.csv`: Training data containing image features.
- `train_label.csv`: Training labels.
- `test_X.csv`: Test data containing image features.
- `test_label.csv`: Test labels.


The script will train the neural network and display the accuracy on both the training and test datasets.

## Results

After training the neural network, you can expect to see the following results:

- Training accuracy: 95.5%
- Test accuracy: 85.43%
